# Sport-Club

Project Overview: SportClub is a comprehensive management system designed for sports clubs. The system facilitates seamless interaction between employees and clients, offering tailored functionalities based on user privileges.
Key Features:
User Registration:
Users must register in the system to gain access.
Post-registration, users are granted specific privileges based on their roles (client, trainer, dietitian, administrator).
Clients:
Subscription Requirements:
Clients must have an active subscription (membership) to access the club's facilities.
Memberships are categorized into three types: Basic, Standard, and Premium, each granting different levels of access to various zones within the club.
Clients with a lapsed subscription exceeding six months are automatically removed from the system.
Service Selection:
Clients can choose and register with trainers or dietitians.
They can also sign up for group sessions.
Group Sessions:
Group sessions have a schedule with a defined minimum and maximum number of participants, ensuring optimal class sizes.
Completed sessions are archived and removed from the system if they concluded more than six months ago.
